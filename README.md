# COBOL LEARNING EXERCISES 

This repository contains my COBOL practice programs.
I am currently learning the fundamentals of COBOL, including basic syntax, data types, control structures, and simple file handling.
These programs reflect my progress as I build my skills step by step toward becoming a COBOL developer.

The exercise is:    Ask to the user for his name and for his date of birth. From his date of birth calculate the user's age.

--> cbloper.cbl // PROGRAM FINISHED
In this file i started working on data, operations, how to take input from the user and how to display them. The exercise is about showing to the user a menu of math operations and let him choose which one. After choosing and making sure that the choice is valid i ask to the user input numbers for calculation.
