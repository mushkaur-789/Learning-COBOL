# COBOL LEARNING EXERCISES 

This repository contains my COBOL practice programs.
I am currently learning the fundamentals of COBOL, including basic syntax, data types, control structures, and simple file handling.
These programs reflect my progress as I build my skills step by step toward becoming a COBOL developer.
